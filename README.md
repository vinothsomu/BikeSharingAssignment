# Bike Sharing Assignment
> A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free.
> We have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.

## General Information
- Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.
- The company want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.
- Find out the variables which are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes. How well those variables describe the bike demands.
